               <h2>Sorting Algorithm</h2>
               <p>
                Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.   
               </p>
               <p>
                This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science. For a long time, new methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster.
                The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Types of Sorting </h2>
               <p>
                There are various Sorting Techniques like Bubble sort , Insertion Sort ,Selection Sort , Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, tree sort , shell sort , count sort, bucket and radix sort . each of these sorting techniques has its own characterisctics.
                We use some Criteria for Comparing these Sorting Techniques and  decide best one according to work requirement.
               </p>

                       <li>
                           <h4>Time Complexity </h4>
                           <p>
                            Time complexity of algorithm decide how much time it take to sort a particular data. Time complexity of sorting Algorithm mainly depend on number of comparison.   
                           </p>
                       </li>

                        <h4>Space Complexity</h4>
                        <p>
                            The space complexity of an algorithm  is the amount of memory space required to sort particular data or any other computational problem.  
                        </p>
                       </li>
                       <p>
                        Most of them fall into three categories:   
                    </p>

                                Logarithmic   
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                The complexity is proportional to the binary logarithm (i.e to the base 2) of n.
                                An example of a logarithmic sorting algorithm is Quick sort, with space and time complexity O(n Ã— log n).   
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             <h5> Quadratic</h5>
                             <p>
                                The complexity is proportional to the square of n.
                                An example of a quadratic sorting algorithm is Bubble sort, with a time complexity of O(n2).    
                             </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                The complexity is propotional to n.
                                An example of a linear sorting algorithm is count sort, radix sort, bin sort.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        It clears that whether Sorting algorithm require any extra space of memory for comparison  and storing data elements.
                        These algorithms do not require any extra space and sorting is said to happen in-place,
                        If it requires space which is more than or equal to the elements being sorted then this sorting is not inplace type .

                   </h4>
                   <p>
                    A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted.    
                   </p>

                Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it's easy to get confused. We believe visualizing sorting algorithms can be a great way to better understand their functioning while having fun!
